------------------------------------------

To use this kit, put it in the directory of your DocBook project, and have
a look at the example/ dir to see how to use it in your project.

The Makefile include automatically downloads DocBook if necessary,
and automatically builds your project (and its depended-on files).

The makefile provides the following commands:
- 'make': Create HTML and PDF versions (if available) of the document
- 'make html': Create a HTML version of the document
- 'make pdf': Create a PDF version of the document
- 'make txt': Create a text version of the document
- 'make clean': Clean up all generated files
